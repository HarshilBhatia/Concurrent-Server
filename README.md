# Concurrent-Server
My plan is to examine several popular concurrency models for network servers that handle multiple clients simultaneously, and judge those models on scalability and ease of implementation. All servers will listen for socket connections and implement a simple protocol to interact with clients. This is going to be something similar to redis _hopefully_
## My Goal ? 
Better understand the following
* threads and thread pools 
* async callback and promises 
* and maybe redis
